One way for a recipient to check whether a certificate is valid is by verifying its digital signature, using its issuer's (signer's) public key. That key can itself be stored within another certificate whose signature can also be verified by using the public key of that next certificate's issuer, and that key may also be stored in yet another certificate, and so on. You can stop checking when you reach a public key that you already trust and use it to verify the signature on the corresponding certificate.

If the recipient cannot establish a trust chain, then he/she can calculate the the certificate fingerprint(s), using the keytool -import or -printcert command. A fingerprint is a relatively short number that uniquely and reliably identifies the certificate. (Technically, the fingerprint is a hash value of the certificate information, using a message digest function.) The recipient can then phone the certificate owner and compare the fingerprint values of the received certificate with the certificate that was sent. If the fingerprints are the same, the certificates are the same.
